The programs I'm working with are:

1. MPLAB X IDE with XC8 Compiler:
    => Create, Compile, Run and Debug programs.
    => To create a program, follow these steps:
        * Create a project with all its configuration (Project Type, uC Family, uC Type, Compiler, Project Name, ...)
        * Add program file to the project
        * Write the program code
        * Build and Debug the code
        * Save the program files

2. Proteus 8:
    => Simulate the programs inputs and outputs.
    => To create a simulation, follow these steps:
        * Create a Schematic Capture
        * Select Components Mode
        * Click P -> Search for components
        * Add the components to the canvas
        * Add other essential things (GND, ...)
        * Double click the microcontroller
        * Configure the processor clock frequency
        * Add the program file:
            => MPLABXProjects\\YourProject.X\\dist\\default\\production\\YourProject.X.production.hex
        * Start the simulation
