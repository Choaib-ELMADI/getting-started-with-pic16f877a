1. What is a Timer?
    => A timer is a peripheral of the microcontroller.
    => A Timer is just a counter which counts time.
    => There are 2 types of counts:
        * UP Counting: counts from preprogramed value to max value.
        * DOWN Counting: counts from preprogramed value to 0.

2. Timers Applications:
    => Time delay generation.
    => Measuring frequency of pulses.
    => Generating PWM signals.
    => Triggering external devices or peripherals.

3. Timer Interrupts:
    => When the timer counter goes from max value (or from 0) to the preprogramed value, a timer overflow interrupt occurs.

4. Timer Delay Generation (TMR0):
    >>-> TMR0 is a 8bit timer / counter module.

    => Set the timer prescalar in OPTION_REG:
    --> Just a number that divides the timer clock frequency of the uC, which reduces the speed of the timer counter.
    --> PIC16F877A has a fixed prescalar of 4, and a user defined prescalar.

    => Calculate the load value (preprogramed value) for the required time:
    --> `Load Value` = (255 - TMR0) * prescalar * `Machine Cycle`
    --> `Machine Cycle` = 4 / 20MHz = 200ns

    => Update TMR0 register.

5. Timer Delay Generation (TMR1):
    >>-> TMR1 is a 16bit timer / counter module, which it means that it consists of two registers TMR1L and TMR1H.

    => Enable the TMR1 interrupt with TMR1IE in PIE1.

    => Turn on TMR1 with TMR1ON in T1CON.

    => Set the first bit of the TMR1 prescaler with T1CKPS0 in T1CON.

    => Set the second bit of the TMR1 prescaler with T1CKPS1 in T1CON, resulting in a prescaler value of 1:8 (for every 8 clock cycles, the timer will increment by one count.).

    => Select the internal clock source for TMR1 with TMR1CS in T1CON.

    => Calculate TMR1L and TMR1H for the desired initial value:
    --> `TMR1 Clock Tick Frequency` = _XTAL_FREQ / (4 * prescalar)
    --> `Ticks` = `TMR1 Clock Tick Frequency` * `Desired Time Interval`
    --> `Initial Value` = 65536 - `Ticks`
    --> Split the `Initial Value` into High and Low Bytes

    => Load TMR1L and TMR1H.
