1. What is a Timer?
    => A timer is a peripheral of the microcontroller.
    => A Timer is just a counter which counts time.
    => There are 2 types of counts:
        * UP Counting: counts from preprogramed value to max value.
        * DOWN Counting: counts from preprogramed value to 0.

2. Timers Applications:
    => Time delay generation.
    => Measuring frequency of pulses.
    => Generating PWM signals.
    => Triggering external devices or peripherals.

3. Timer Delay Generation (TMR0):
    => Set the timer prescalar in OPTION_REG.
    --> Just a number that divides the timer clock frequency of the uC, which reduces the speed of the timer counter.
    --> PIC16F877A has a fixed prescalar of 4, and a user defined prescalar.

    => Calculate the load value (preprogramed value) for the required time.
    --> Load Value = (255 - TMR0) * Prescalar * Machine Cycle
    --> Machine Cycle = 4 / 20MHz = 200ns

    => Update TMR0 register with the load value.

4. Timer Interrupts:
    => When the timer counter goes from max value (or from 0) to the preprogramed value, a timer overflow interrupt occurs.
