1. Interrupts in uC:
    => Interrupts are just actions that interrupt the execution of the main program, to execute some lines of code in the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).
    => There are 2 types of interrupts:
        * Software Interrupt: provided from internal sources of the uC, example: ADC INTERRUPT, TIMER INTERRUPT, USART INTERRUPT...
        * Hardware Interrupt: provided from external sources to the uC, example: EXTERNAL INTERRUPT...
    => In PIC16F877A, RB0 is the external interrupt pin.

2. Why Interrupts?
    => Saves time to the microcontroller.
