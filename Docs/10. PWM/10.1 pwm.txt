1. What is Pulse Width Modulation?
    => PWM simply means that we vary the pulse width to control the power delivered to any circuit.
    => Some of PWM applications:
        * Voltage Regulation
        * Brightness Adjustment
        * Speed Control of a Motor
        * ...

2. PWM Frequency and Time Period:

3. Duty Cycle:
    => Duty cycle means the percentage of the time period during which the `tON` period is defined.
