1. PWM Register Configuration:
    >>-> The PIC16F877A has two channels to generate PWM signals RC2\CCP1 and RC1\CCP2.
    >>-> TMR2 is frequently preferred to generate the PWM wave.

    => Turn on the TMR2 in T2CON.

    => Set the TMR2 prescalar in T2CON.

    => Set the PWM mode with CCPxM3 -> CCPxM0 in CCP1CON.

    => Set the PWM frequency in PR2:
    --> `PWM Period` = (PR2 + 1) * `Machine Cycle` * `TMR2 Prescalar Value`
    --> `Machine Cycle` = 4 / 20MHz = 200ns
    --> `PWM Period` = 1 / `PWM Frequency`

    => Set the 10bit duty cycle value in CCP1CON and CCPR1L.
