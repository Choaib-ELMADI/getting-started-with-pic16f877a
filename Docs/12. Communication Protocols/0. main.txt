1. Communication Types:
    => Communication in devices like microcontrollers is of two types:
        * Parallel Communication (check images)
        * Serial Communication (check images)

    => Based on clock, there is:
        * Synchronous Communication
        * Asynchronous Communication (no clock)

2. UART:
    => UART === Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter:
        * It's of type Serial Asynchronous
        * Because it's an asynchronous communication, we need some common configuration between transmitter and receiver:
            - Transmission Speed: refered to as "Baud Rate", 9600 is a common baud rate ==> 9600 bits per second
            - Data Length: both should have the same data length, 8 or 16 bits
            - Start and Stop bits:
                + Start bit ==> High to low pulse
                + Stop bit  ==> Low to high pulse*

    => UART Register Configuration for PIC16F877A:
        * Configure TXSTA and RCSTA:
            - TXSTA: Transmit Status and Control Register:
                + TXEN: Transmit Enable Bit
                + BRGH: High Baud Rate Select Bit
            - RCSTA: Receive Status and Control Register:
                + SPEN: Serial Port Enable Bit
                + CREN: Continuous Receive Enable Bit

        * Set baud rate at SPBRG:
            * For BRGH = 0: `baud rate` = `Fosc` / (64 * (SPBRG + 1))
            * For BRGH = 1: `baud rate` = `Fosc` / (16 * (SPBRG + 1))

        * Write functions for receiving and transmitting data:
            * RCIF in PIR1 Register: USART Receive Interrupt Flag Bit
            * TXIF in PIR1 Register: USART Transmit Interrupt Flag Bit

            // Transmit one data byte
            void tx(unsigned char data) {
                if (PIR1bits.TXIF == 1) {   // Check if the transmit buffer is empty
                    TXREG = data;           // Load data to the transmit buffer
                    PIR1bits.TXIF = 0;
                }
            }

            // Transmit a string data
            void string_tx(const unsigned char *str, unsigned char len) {
                unsigned char i;
                for (i=0; i<len; ++i) {
                    tx(str[i]);
                    __delay_ms(200);
                }
            }

            // Receive using interrupt
            void interrupt receive() {
                if (PIR1bits.RCIF == 1) {   // Check if receive buffer is full
                    y = RCREG;              // Read data from receive buffer
                    PIR1bits.RCIF = 0;
                }
            }

3. SPI:
    => SPI === Serial Peripheral Interface:
        * The SPI bus allows communication between one master device and one or more slave devices
        * Four IOs are dedicated to the SPI communication protocol:
            - SCK: Serial Clock, from master to slaves
            - MOSI: Master Out Slave In, used to transmit data in master mode and receive data in slave mode
            - MISO: Master In Slave Out, used to transmit data in slave mode and receive data in master mode
            - SS: Slave Select, a master's GPIO to select a slave to communicate with

    => SPI Configuration for PIC16F877A:
        * SSPEN in SSPCON1: Synchronous Serial Port Enable Bit
        * CKP in SSPCON1: Clock Polarity Select Bit
        * SSPM3->SSPM0 in SSPCON1: Synchronous Serial Port Mode Select Bits

        * CKE in SSPSTAT: SPI Clock Select Bit
        * SMP in SSPSTAT: Sample Bit

4. I2C:
    => I2C === Inter Integrated Circuit:
        * In I2C protocol, the master talks to the slave devices by its address as we have common data and clock lines
        * SDA and SCL lines:
            - Both of them are bidirectional and are connected to the positive supply voltage via pullup resistors

    => I2C Working Principle:
        Start Bit     -           Address Byte           - Acknowledgement Bit -        Data Byte   - Acknowledgement Bit - Stop Bit
