1. Watchdog Timer:
    => A Watchdog Timer is a hardware timer that automatically generates a system reset if the main program neglects to periodically service(reset) it.
    => The Watchdog Timer is clocked from a separate on-chip oscillator which runs at 1MHz.
    => RC oscillator handles the watchdog timer.
    => It's often used to automatically reset an Arduino that hangs because of a software or a hardware fault.

2. Power Down Modes:
    => There are 3 categories of power management modes:
        > Run Mode: clocks for both core and peripherals are active [Active Mode/State].
        > Idle Mode: allow the controller's CPU to be selectively shut down while the peripherals continue to operate [Hibernate Mode].
        > Sleep Mode: lowest current consumption state.

3. Brownout Reset:
    => A Brownout of a microcontroller is a partial and temporary reduction in the power supply voltage, below the level required for reliable operation.
    => Many microcontrollers have a protection circuit which detects when the voltage goes below this level and puts the device into a reset state.
    => This action is called a "Brownout Reset" or BOR.

4. Power-on Reset:
    => A power-on Reset circuit is responsible for generating resetting signals whenever power is supplied to a given electrical device.
    => MCLR (Master Clear Reset):
        > MCLR = 0 ===> reset and terminate all activities
        > MCLR = 1 ===> start normal execution
