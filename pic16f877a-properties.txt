1. GPIOs:
    => GPIOs (General Purpose Input Output) are used to interface input and output devices with a microcontroller.
    => PIC16F877A has 5 different GPIO ports:
        > PORTA
        > PORTB
        > PORTC
        > PORTD
        > PORTE

2. Timers:
    => PIC16F877A has 3 timers:
        > TIMER0
        > TIMER1
        > TIMER2

3. ADCs:
    => ADCs (Analog to Digital Converter) modules are used for converting analog signals to digital signals.
    => PIC16F877A ADCs have a resolution of 10bits.

4. PWMs:
    => PWMs (Pulse Width Modulation)
    => 10bits resolution.
    
5. External Interrupt:

6. EEPROM (256 bytes):
    => EEPROM (Electrically Erased Programmed Read Only Memory)

7. Communication Protocols:
    > USART (Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)
    > SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
    > I2C (Inter Integrated Communication)
